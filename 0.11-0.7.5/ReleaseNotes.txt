Trac Graphviz Plugin v0.7.1 Release Notes
=========================================
March 18, 2008

Graphviz plugin v0.7.1 for Trac is now available. The v0.7.x series
provides support for Trac 0.11. The Graphviz wiki processor is a
plugin for Trac that allows the the dynamic generation of diagrams by
the various graphviz programs. The text of a wiki page can contain the
source text for graphviz and the web browser will show the resulting
image.


Changes for release v0.7.1
--------------------------

* Changed the interfaces used to communicate w/ Trac to support Trac
  0.11.

* Replaced the use of os.popen3 with subprocess.Popen to better
  support running on Windows. This implies that the Graphviz plugin
  requires Python 2.4 and above.

* Renamed GraphvizMacro to Graphviz.

* Added support for OS X when searching for the Graphviz executable
  programs. Fixes #1999.

* Expanded the default locations used when searching for the Graphviz
  executable programs.


Changes for release v0.7.0
--------------------------

* Internal release.


Changes for release v0.6.8
--------------------------

* Added better support for non-ascii characters in graphviz wiki
  documents.


Changes for release v0.6.7
--------------------------

* The GraphvizMacro v0.6.5 release introduced a bug with the now
  optional cmd_path. If run on a platform whose sys.platform name is
  not in the GraphvizMacro.cmd_paths dictionary, the self.cmd_path
  variable isn't initialized. This caused a wee problem and stack
  trace in Trac.


Changes for release v0.6.6
--------------------------

* The GraphvizMacro v0.6.5 release introduced a bug with the
  IHTMLPreviewRenderer interface. The render method assumed that the
  content parameter was an object with a read method. Under trac 0.10
  with a Subversion repository, this object is a svn.core.Stream.
  Under trac 0.9 the object is a string with the contents from the
  repository. As a result, the v0.6.5 wouldn't render the images and
  the raw text was displayed.


Changes for release v0.6.5
--------------------------

* The default graphviz processor is now the only processor that must
  be found on the system. GraphvizMacro will not work without it. If
  any of the other processors are missing, a warning message will be
  sent to the trac log, the processor will be removed from the list of
  known GraphvizMacro processors and GraphvizMacro will continue.
  Resolves issue http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/159.

* The cmd_path configuration parameter in trac.ini is now
  optional. Reasonable default values have been set for Linux, Win32
  and FreeBSD6.

* Altered the way the GraphvizMacro description is returned in
  get_macro_description. Instead of returning a description for each
  variant (graphviz, graphviz/png, graphviz/svg, etc.) only return a
  description for graphviz. This will cleanup the WikiMacros page a
  bit to hopefully make it easier to navigate. It isn't a perfect
  solution since all the graphviz macro names are still displayed but
  it no longer repeats the same description for each
  permutation. Resolves issue http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/284.

* Implemented the IRequestHandler interface to return graphviz
  generated images. This means that graphviz images can be referenced
  via http://URL_TO_TRAC_SERVER/graphviz/HASH_KEY. As a result of this
  change, the prefix_url configuration parameter is no longer needed
  in the trac.ini file. Resolves issue
  http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/86.

* Links within images that are rendered as SVG are now automatically
  prefixed with javascript:window.parent.location.href= to force the
  link to be displayed in the parent window instead of the SVG object
  window. Resolves issue http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/560.

* Included the processor options when calculating the sha key used for
  the image file name. This should help in testing various graphviz
  settings in trac.ini. Resolves issue
  http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/575.

* Fixed expand_wiki_links to allow for javascript URL
  references. Resolves issue http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/559.

* GraphvizMacro is now also an IHTMLPreviewRenderer. This was done by
  adding application/graphviz as the mimetype for files with the
  extension of .graphviz, .dot, .neato, .twopi, .circo and .fdp. When
  browsing the source code in the respoitory, any files with those
  extensions will be treated as graphviz programs and will be rendered
  via the GraphvizMacro. Resolves issue
  http://trac-hacks.org/attachment/ticket/576.

* Escaped the error message before displaying it. Resolves issue
  http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/574.


Changes for release v0.6.4
--------------------------

* Fixed problem where boolean values in the trac.ini file for Graphviz
  would always evaluate to True.  Resolves issue
  http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/373.


Changes for release v0.6.3
--------------------------

* Corrected Trac 0.10 specific config API calls to allow the plugin to
  work with 0.9 as well as 0.10 releases of Trac.


Changes for release v0.6.2
--------------------------

* Simplify the code to read the configuration files. Instead of having
  lots of if structures, default values are passed as a parameter to
  the self.config.get call.

* Renamed Readme.txt to README.txt.

* Added a additional comment to README.txt about rsvg not being
  available on Windows.

* Changed plugin structure to use entry_points in setup.py instead of
  graphviz.egg-info/trac_plugin.txt.

* Removed graphviz.egg-info from svn repository. It is generated via
  "python setup.py bdist_egg" and shouldn't be in the repository.

* Added Windows trac.ini [graphviz] example.

* Fixed access to global vs local config variables. Resolves issue
  http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/242.


Changes for release v0.6.1
--------------------------

* Applied patch from eblot to correct the regular expression for
  embedded URLs. Resolves issue http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/161.

* Renamed module variable __version__ to __revision__ to better
  reflect the intent.

* Moved the release version number from setup.py to
  graphviz/graphviz.py. The version number is now logged when the
  graphviz module is initialized.

* Commented out the many self.log.debug messages. As pointed out in,
  http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/238, the core seems to be mostly stable
  and having lots and lots of debugging messages may no longer be
  needed.

* Added defaults for the cache management control values:

  * cache_max_size = 10,000,000
  * cache_min_size = 5,000,000
  * cache_max_count = 2,000
  * cache_min_count = 1,500

  The resolves issue http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/160.


Changes for release v0.6
------------------------

 * In render_macro, corrected the self.log.debug statements that were
   printing out the req.args and req.base_url. They are not always
   available. Removed the reference to req.base_url since it was not
   being used and may not always be an attribute to req.  Resolves
   issue http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/193.

 * Added import for the inspect module. Resolves issue
   http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/236.


Changes for release v0.5.1
--------------------------

 * Corrected typo in graphviz.py where the wrong internal variable was
   being used to display an error message.


Changes for release v0.5
------------------------

 * Added a note in the Readme.txt wrt using load_examples.py to import
   the Graphviz examples into a wiki. Fixed load_examples.py so that
   it correctly looks for Graphviz examples in directories other than
   the working directory.

 * Fixed a bug whereby image maps were a bit off when using the png
   antialiasing option.

 * URL= strings in diagrams can now have Trac wiki links like
   ticket:1, report:7, changeset:47, wiki:CamelCasePage,
   milestone:milestone1 and source:Readme.txt.

 * Added additional examples for links in SVG images and using Trac
   wiki links.

 * Fixed the bug #102 (http://trac-hacks.swapoff.org/ticket/102)
   whereby popen2.Popen3 is not available on Windows.


Changes for release v0.4
------------------------

 * Map support for bitmap images, allowing to use URL="" attributes in
   graphs. Maps are only generated if the URL= string is found in the
   Graphviz diagram.

 * Antialiasing on PNG images, using rsvg, from
   <http://librsvg.sf.net>.

 * Better display of SVG images and IE support.

 * Display errors graphviz may produce.

 * Support for global graph options.

 * Updated documentation.

 * Example graphs have been created to outline the basic capabilities
   of the plugin.

 * The tmp_dir is no longer needed. Instead of creating temp files to
   be processed by graphviz, the plugin now communicates with the
   graphviz programs through pipes.

 * Expanded info and debugging messages to allow for better debugging
   of the running environment.

 * Error messages that occur when running the grapviz programs will
   now be displayed in the browser. This should help in resolving
   syntax problems with graphviz code.

 * Graphviz program paths are now enclosed in quotes. This should
   resolve the problem when there are spaces in the path as is typical
   on Windows.


Changes for release v0.3
------------------------

 * A simple cache manager has been added to keep the cache disk space
   and directory entry count under control. A series of parameters in
   the [graphviz] section of the trac.ini configuration file are used
   to control the cache manager.

 * The tmp files used in processing the graphviz language are now
   deleted after the new image is created.

 * A series of debugging statements are now in the code. See the Trac
   logging documentation section for details on how logging works.
